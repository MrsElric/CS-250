    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Interpreting customer needs is easy when you ask them what they want or need in a product and then listen. If you think about it from their point of view, what would be most beneficial to them? Creating user stories helps put you in the user's shoes as you are creating your value satement. You clearly state, "As an end user (customer), I want..." and then you state what they want and what actions you need to take to get there. 
  Open communication helps a lot with this, not placing blame on any one person and working together, respectably, to the same end-goal. That's what needs to be carried forward into future development work, for myself and others. No placing blame, no hostility, just repsect and honest communication. Being accountable for your own actions and working together to make the code, and the team, better than when you started. 
  A good team member is someone who doesn't focus solely on themselves, they take the time to read their e-mails, respond to their coworkers, and work with their team members to complete their tasks. For example, what good is one single developer without a tester? Or even a fresh set of eyes to look at their work to see what they could be missing? A team is more than one person, and a good team member is someone who remembers that.
